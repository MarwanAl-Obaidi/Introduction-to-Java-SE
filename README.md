# Introduction-to-Java-SE
A course I did that teaches the fundamentals of Java programming.

## ex_3_1
First copy the example source code below to the text box further down. Example includes syntax errors. Press “answer” button. Carmatic checking and feedback system tells you where and what kind of error the code contains. You can also see what the Java-compiler says about the error. Find the errors in the given code and fix them so that the source code does not contain syntax errors and the program works according to the example print.

Program is written to a class called Introduction.

```
public class first

  public static void main (String [] args) {
    System.out.println("First contact with programming.")
  }
}
```

## ex_3_2
Create a Java-program that prints “Hi all!” on screen.

Program is written to a class called Greeting.
